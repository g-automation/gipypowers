# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**

```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:
[Show failures]
Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Detect Environment

**Determine workspace state before presenting options:**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State                                  | Menu                         | Cleanup                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo)  | Standard 4 options           | No worktree to clean up         |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch  | Standard 4 options           | Provenance-based (see Step 6)   |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 3 options (no merge) | No cleanup (externally managed) |

### Step 3: Determine Base Branch

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 4: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 4 options:**

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?
1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work
Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).
1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)
3. Discard this work
Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>
<test command>   # Verify tests on merged result
# Only after merge succeeds: cleanup worktree (Step 6), then delete branch
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then `git branch -d <feature-branch>`.

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
```

**Do NOT clean up worktree** — user needs it alive to iterate on PR feedback.

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>." **Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**

```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>
Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation. If confirmed:

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then force-delete branch: `git branch -D <feature-branch>`.

### Step 6: Cleanup Workspace

**Only runs for Options 1 and 4.** Options 2 and 3 always preserve the worktree.

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If worktree path is under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** Superpowers created this worktree — we own cleanup.

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**Otherwise:** The host environment (harness) owns this workspace. Do NOT remove it. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it. Otherwise, leave the workspace in place.

## Quick Reference

| Option           | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 1. Merge locally | yes   | -    | -             | yes            |
| 2. Create PR     | -     | yes  | yes           | -              |
| 3. Keep as-is    | -     | -    | yes           | -              |
| 4. Discard       | -     | -    | -             | yes (force)    |

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping test verification** — merge broken code, create failing PR. Fix: always verify tests before offering options.
- **Open-ended questions** — "What should I do next?" is ambiguous. Fix: present exactly 4 structured options (or 3 for detached HEAD).
- **Cleaning up worktree for Option 2** — removes worktree user needs for PR iteration. Fix: only cleanup for Options 1 and 4.
- **Deleting branch before removing worktree** — `git branch -d` fails because worktree still references the branch. Fix: merge first, remove worktree, then delete branch.
- **Running `git worktree remove` from inside the worktree** — fails silently when CWD is inside the worktree being removed. Fix: always `cd` to main repo root before `git worktree remove`.
- **Cleaning up harness-owned worktrees** — causes phantom state. Fix: only clean up worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`.
- **No confirmation for discard** — accidentally delete work. Fix: require typed "discard" confirmation.

## Red Flags

**Never:** proceed with failing tests · merge without verifying tests on result · delete work without confirmation · force-push without explicit request · remove a worktree before confirming merge success · clean up worktrees you didn't create (provenance check) · run `git worktree remove` from inside the worktree.

**Always:** verify tests before offering options · detect environment before presenting menu · present exactly 4 options (or 3 for detached HEAD) · get typed confirmation for Option 4 · clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only · `cd` to main repo root before worktree removal · run `git worktree prune` after removal.
