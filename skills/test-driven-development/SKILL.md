# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

**Always:** new features, bug fixes, refactoring, behavior changes.

**Exceptions (ask your human partner):** throwaway prototypes, generated code, configuration files.

Thinking "skip TDD just this once"? Stop. That's rationalization.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:** don't keep it as "reference," don't "adapt" it while writing tests, don't look at it. Delete means delete. Implement fresh from tests. Period.

## Red-Green-Refactor

### RED — Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen. One behavior, clear name, real code (no mocks unless unavoidable).

<Good>`test('retries failed operations 3 times', ...)` — clear name, tests real behavior, one thing</Good>
<Bad>`test('retry works', ...)` with a fully mocked function — vague name, tests mock not code</Bad>

### Verify RED — Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.** Run the test. Confirm: test fails (not errors), failure message is expected, fails because feature missing (not typos).

- **Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.
- **Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN — Minimal Code

Write the simplest code to pass the test. Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test (e.g. don't add unrequested options/config — YAGNI).

### Verify GREEN — Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.** Run the test. Confirm: test passes, other tests still pass, output pristine (no errors/warnings).

- **Test fails?** Fix code, not test.
- **Other tests fail?** Fix now.

### REFACTOR — Clean Up

After green only: remove duplication, improve names, extract helpers. Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

### Repeat

Next failing test for next feature.

## Good Tests

| Quality          | Good                                | Bad                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal**      | One thing. "and" in name? Split it. | `test('validates email and domain and whitespace')` |
| **Clear**        | Name describes behavior             | `test('test1')`                                     |
| **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API            | Obscures what code should do                        |

## Why Order Matters

- **"I'll write tests after"** — tests written after code pass immediately, proving nothing (might test wrong thing, test implementation not behavior, miss edge cases). Test-first forces you to see it fail, proving it tests something.
- **"I already manually tested it"** — ad-hoc, not systematic: no record, can't re-run, easy to forget under pressure.
- **"Deleting X hours is wasteful"** — sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt.
- **"TDD is dogmatic, pragmatic means adapting"** — TDD IS pragmatic: finds bugs before commit, prevents regressions, documents behavior, enables refactoring. "Pragmatic" shortcuts = debugging in production = slower.
- **"Tests after achieve the same goals"** — no. Tests-after answer "what does this do?" (biased by your implementation). Tests-first answer "what should this do?" (force edge-case discovery before implementing).

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse                                 | Reality                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Too simple to test"                   | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds.                              |
| "I'll test after"                      | Tests passing immediately prove nothing.                                |
| "Tests after achieve same goals"       | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
| "Already manually tested"              | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run.                           |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful"         | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt.           |
| "Keep as reference, write tests first" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete.             |
| "Need to explore first"                | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD.                           |
| "Test hard = design unclear"           | Listen to test. Hard to test = hard to use.                             |
| "TDD will slow me down"                | TDD faster than debugging. Pragmatic = test-first.                      |
| "Manual test faster"                   | Manual doesn't prove edge cases. You'll re-test every change.           |
| "Existing code has no tests"           | You're improving it. Add tests for existing code.                       |

## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

Code before test · test after implementation · test passes immediately · can't explain why test failed · tests added "later" · rationalizing "just this once" · "I already manually tested it" · "tests after achieve the same purpose" · "it's about spirit not ritual" · "keep as reference" or "adapt existing code" · "already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful" · "TDD is dogmatic, I'm being pragmatic" · "this is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

## Example: Bug Fix

**Bug:** Empty email accepted.

**RED:** `test('rejects empty email', ...)` expecting `result.error === 'Email required'`.
**Verify RED:** `npm test` → `FAIL: expected 'Email required', got undefined`.
**GREEN:** add `if (!data.email?.trim()) return { error: 'Email required' };`
**Verify GREEN:** `npm test` → `PASS`.
**REFACTOR:** extract validation for multiple fields if needed.

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered

Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.

## When Stuck

| Problem                | Solution                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. Ask your human partner. |
| Test too complicated   | Design too complicated. Simplify interface.                          |
| Must mock everything   | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection.                          |
| Test setup huge        | Extract helpers. Still complex? Simplify design.                     |

## Debugging Integration

Bug found? Write failing test reproducing it. Follow TDD cycle. Test proves fix and prevents regression. Never fix bugs without a test.

## Testing Anti-Patterns

When adding mocks or test utilities, read [testing-anti-patterns.md](testing-anti-patterns.md) to avoid common pitfalls: testing mock behavior instead of real behavior, adding test-only methods to production classes, mocking without understanding dependencies.

## Final Rule

```
Production code → test exists and failed first
Otherwise → not TDD
```

No exceptions without your human partner's permission.
